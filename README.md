# 🚀 5G Network Resource Allocation Analysis

A comprehensive machine learning project analyzing 5G network performance data to understand and predict resource allocation patterns in modern telecommunications infrastructure.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores how 5G networks intelligently allocate resources based on application types, signal conditions, and network performance metrics. Using real-world network data, we build predictive models to understand the decision-making algorithms behind Quality of Service (QoS) management in 5G systems.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Analyze** 5G network resource allocation patterns across different applications
- **Understand** the relationship between signal quality, latency, and bandwidth allocation
- **Build** machine learning models to predict resource allocation percentages
- **Extract** actionable insights for network optimization and capacity planning
- **Demonstrate** telecommunications domain knowledge through data science

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Size**: 400 network requests with 8 performance metrics
- **Domain**: 5G telecommunications network management
- **Features**: Signal strength, latency, bandwidth requirements, application types
- **Target**: Resource allocation percentage (60-90% range)
- **Applications**: Video calls, gaming, streaming, emergency services, voice calls

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Network Intelligence Discovered:
- **Application-driven allocation**: Different apps receive customized resource treatment
- **Signal compensation**: Poor signal conditions get 20% more resources automatically
- **Discrete allocation tiers**: Network uses predefined levels (70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%)
- **Bandwidth efficiency**: Consistent 20% over-provisioning across all applications

### Model Performance:
- **Random Forest**: 92.2% accuracy (R² = 0.922)
- **Feature importance**: Application type (65%) > Bandwidth (18%) > Signal strength (8%)
- **Production ready**: 2.6% average prediction error suitable for real deployments

## 📈 Business Impact

### Telecommunications Insights:
- **Emergency services** get guaranteed low latency (15ms) with high allocation (85%)
- **Video calls** dominate bandwidth (12 Mbps) but receive fair resource allocation
- **Network load balancing** ensures equal treatment across all users
- **Quality of Service** maintained regardless of signal conditions
